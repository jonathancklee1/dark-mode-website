# Dark Mode Website

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of my Dark Mode Website. This is a project that focuses on building my knowledge in React, with the implementation of theming via the use of useContext hook, as well as Tailwind CSS. You can find information about the history, benefits, implementation and examples of dark mode as you navigate the site. This project also helped me further explore animation using the GSAP library. Using Figma, I also made mock-ups of the initial website which allowed me to develop my design skills.
